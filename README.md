# Al-Adhan | Swift Student Challenge 2025  

This repository contains my **Swift Student Challenge 2025** submission: **Al-Adhan** (Islamic Prayers), an iOS Swift Playground app designed to provide a simple, ad-free, and privacy-focused way for Muslims to access accurate prayer times and essential Islamic tools. The app caters to both lifelong Muslims and new converts, ensuring an accessible and meaningful prayer experience.  

This project is based on my iOS app, [**Al-Adhan | Prayer Times**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/al-adhan-prayer-times/id6475015493?platform=iphone), and showcases my commitment to building ethical and user-friendly Islamic applications that respect privacy and enhance worship.  

Submitted in **February 2025**.  

## Features  

- **Accurate Prayer Times**:  
  Uses Batoul Apps’ [Adhan Swift](https://github.com/batoulapps/adhan-swift) package to calculate precise daily prayer times based on location.  

- **Qibla Compass**:  
  Easily find the direction of the Ka'bah in Mecca to ensure accurate prayer alignment.  

- **Traveling Mode**:  
  A unique feature that automatically adjusts prayer rules for travelers, allowing for shortened (Qasr) prayers, as permitted in Islam.  

- **Ad-Free and Private**:  
  Unlike many Islamic apps that sell user data or require subscriptions, Al-Adhan collects **no data** and is **completely free with no ads**.  

- **Essential Islamic Tools**:  
  Includes a Hijri calendar converter, common supplications (duas), an Arabic alphabet guide, and a Tasbih counter for dhikr.
